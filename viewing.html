	<em>How The Viewing Experience Has Been improved</em>
<br>
<br>
	Technology has improved the viewers' experience when watching sports from your home. Nowadays everyone is used to everything being on demand, but it was not always like that. An article has stated “Watching the game live on OTT (Over The Top) platforms is of great convenience to our audience. Initially, people could only catch the live matches of their favourite teams either on television or through a live commentary on radio(Kandpal).” Many fans were limited to the places where they could hear or watch the game live. If people missed the game there was no way to go back and watch it. Instead they would just have to overhear their friends talk about the game while they felt left out, but now people can watch the game they missed anytime and anywhere. In case you are a busy person or don't have the attention span to watch the full hour to three hour game. Companies have started to upload the full game highlights on Youtube  (Kandpal).  So now you can watch highlights and the repetitions of the game on demand.

	<em>How The Viewing Experience Has Been improved</em>
<br>
<br>
Technology keeps improving the quality of broadcasting and keeps finding new ways for fans to enjoy watching sports. Everyone is focused on the future and how things will change over time and many people think virtual reality will take over some day. Many streaming services have started getting creative and innovative during and after the pandemic. “VR offers a lot of potential to experiment and try new ideas for broadcasters. (Kandpal)” This is a great idea for many reasons. Going to watch a game can be expensive. Some expenses people usually have to pay for are plane tickets, renting a hotel and purchasing your seat. With VR it allows a similar experience to actually being there for a significantly lower price.(Kandpal). Technology has improved the way we watch sports on TV. This excerpt shows how much the quality has gone up. “Today when we see matches live on television or online, the clarity of picture and sound quality is much better than what it used to be a few years ago. The cameras that are used to shoot live matches offer superior picture quality and clarity (Kandpal).” We have gone from having to listen to sports on the radio or watch TV in a small bulky box in black and white. To now having flat screen TV’s in 4k resolution with better audio and in color.  </h3>

	<em>Improvements To Broadcasting</em>
<br>
<br>
Sports being broadcasted live has changed drastically. There are many small things people take for granted and that we can't live without anymore.“ Viewers had to rely on announcers mentioning the relevant information or wait to see a line score flash on the screen (Sandomir).” It was not that long ago that the score wasn't shown on TV. So if you turned on the TV in the middle of the game you would not know who was winning until they announced it. They have used technology to improve football by adding the first down line on TV. “Since the late 1990s, the virtual yellow line has been quietly enhancing football broadcasts by giving viewers a live, intuitive guide to the state of play. The graphic is engineered to appear painted on the field, rather than simply plopped on top of the players, so it doesn’t distract from the game at all”(Fong). Back in the day viewers would not know how many more yards their team needed to reach first down. It is a very discreet but important part of improving the viewers' experience. Next gen stats have started to add chips inside the footballs to find out how fast the football is going. They have also started putting chips in uniforms to track how fast the players are running.  </h3>
