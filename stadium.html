<h3>
	<em>Stadium Improvements</em>
	<br>
	<br>
	Stadiums have improved in order to give fans a better experience. Going to watch a game live can be expensive so many want to receive the experience that they paid for. Many companies have started to enhance their stadium experience. One example of this is “Better Wi-Fi. Connectivity is super important, not just for fans, but for venue staff, contractors, vendors, press and VIP guests. Stadiums don’t want to see younger fans leaving the venue at half-time just so they can get online (Parker).” Stadiums have started improving their wifi. Back in the day the internet would be slow so many fans would have to exit the stadium in order to get a better signal. Stadiums have begun to be more innovative in order to facilitate the experience making it a less stressful experience for the fans. Many arenas have started to help the fans when they get to the stadium. Finding parking for a sporting event can literally take hours at times. Some ways they have improved is by making apps that show you open parking. “These apps allow fans to do everything from find parking spots, locate their seats and order food to watch high-definition instant replay videos and close-up videos and view exclusive content(Parker).” The apps also help people locate their seat (Parker). Sometimes people want food but don't want to miss the game, but now fans can buy food from their phone and have it sent to your seat without having to stand up and miss the game. They have also made the games more interactive with the fans.“The Dallas Cowboys have a state-of-the-art app which sends a push notification to fans at set times telling them to push their ‘unite this house’ button, causing their phones to vibrate and the camera to flash. The resulting crowd noise and flashes are synchronized in an ‘electronic wave (Parker).” The fans are more involved in the game making it a fun experience for everyone.</h3>
