<h3>
	<em>Improved Fairness</em>
	<br>
	<br>
	There have been many questionable calls by referees throughout the years. It is always frustrating watching your favorite team lose because of a bad call. At times a wrong call can change the whole outcome of the game and can be the deciding factor of the game. Sometimes the referees are not able to make the right call but with VAR the referees can make a more accurate call. This quote is significant because it goes more in depth into what VAR is “VAR, which is short for video assistant referee, leverages emerging camera technologies in sports to make refereeing more precise (Roda)”. It helps the referees make an accurate call by giving them multiple angles of the play making it easier for them to make the right call.(Roda). This passage demonstrates how it helps referees “With VAR, a team of referees located in the control room analyzes and corrects every missed call or non-call in the game, along with goals, penalty calls, and cases of mistaken identity(Roda)”. It limits the amount of foul play and it eliminates the bias of a referee since multiple people get to analyze the play(Roda). For example in Super Bowl LVII it was the Chiefs against the Eagles a wrong holding call was the reason why the eagles ended up losing the Super Bowl. On the occasion where a wrong foul has been called it impacts the rest of the game. This ends up with the fans being upset since it was an unfair game ruining the experience for many. Athletes are not always innocent, some use performance enhancing drugs. “Technology, in the form of synthetic drugs, has created much of the cheating that officials work hard to eradicate. But testing has become more sophisticated, eliminating much of the cheating.”(Schindel). Although technology is the reason as to why the drug exists it is also the reason why we are able to detect it and make sure every athlete has an equal chance. There have been cases where people find out an athlete was on enhancement performance drugs. One case of this was olympic gold medalist Neil Armstrong getting caught years after and had his medals taken from him.</h3>
